/*
Write a function that computes the dominant writing direction in a string of
text. Remember that each script object has a direction property that can be
"ltr" (left to right), "rtl" (right to left), or "ttb" (top to bottom).
The dominant direction is the direction of a majority of the characters that
have a script associated with them. The characterScript and countBy func-
tions defined earlier in the chapter are probably useful here.
